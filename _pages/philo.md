## General essays in logic, history and philosophy of sciences

I am currently doing a master's degree in [logic, history and philosophy of sciences](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead). You can find here some of my short essays:

- [Philosophy of modal logic](https://leovacher.github.io/files/philo-logique-appr.pdf) (french). On Fitch's paradox of Knowability in epistemic logic.
- [Philosophy of logic](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philosophie_de_la_logique.pdf) (french). On the links between logic and mathematics through the points of view of Henri Poincar√© and Egbertus Jan Brouwer.
- [Philosophy of mathematics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/philo-maths_aprr.pdf) (french). On the role of pictures in mathematical proofs.
- [Philosophy of mathematics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_maths_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the identity of indescirnables in mathematical structuralism.
- [Philosophy of physics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/BQM.pdf) (french). On the inevitability of Copenhagen interpration of Quantum mechanics in the light of the existence of De-Broglie Bohm theory. 
- [Philosophy of physics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Devoir_philophy_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the role of experiment to probe physical hypothesis.
<!---- [Philosophy of physics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Vacher-Leo-903-EC2.pdf) (french). On theoretical underdetermination in physics with a focus on the status of quantum mechanics.-->
- [Philosophy of AI](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_IA_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the ethics of artificial intelligence in contemporary society.
- [Philosophy of biology](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_IA_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the cellular theory in biology.
- [Philosophy and history of biology](https://leovacher.github.io/files/biocell.pdf) (french). On the generation theories in biology.
- [Social epsitemology](https://leovacher.github.io/files/UE901B_EC1_Vacher.pdf) (french). On scientific progress. On this topic, see also my short talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0576_PoDipM&list=PL3w7LDBSX202vaHybj9yab8ApFRCU3a4J&index=9).
- [History and sociology of physics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/UE_903_EC1_histoire.pdf) (french): On the use of PHD defense reports as proxies of the norms of science.

## On Gauge theories

I am currently working on a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and gauge interpretation of gravity and possible geometrisation of Yang-Mills theories rooted in differential geometry.

Here are some of my first writing related to this topic: 

- [History of geodesic](https://leovacher.github.io/files/courbes-Vacher.pdf) curves from the end of the XVIIIth to the beggining of the XIXth century (french). 
- [History of connections and gauge theories](https://leovacher.github.io/files/connexion-Vacher.pdf) in the XXth century (french).
