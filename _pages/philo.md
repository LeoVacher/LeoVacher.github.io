### General essays in logic, history and philosophy of sciences

I am currently doing a master's degree in [logic, history and philosophy of sciences](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead).

You can find here some of my short essays:
- [philosophy of logic](https://leovacher.github.io/files/philo-logique-appr.pdf) (french). On Fitch's paradox of Knowability in epistemic logic.
- [philosophy of mathematics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/philo-maths_aprr.pdf) (french). On the role of pictures in mathematical proofs.
- [philosophy of logic](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philosophie_de_la_logique.pdf) (french). On the links between logic and mathematics through the points of view of Henri Poincar√© and Egbertus Jan Brouwer.
- [philosophy of quantum mechanics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/BQM.pdf) (french). On the inevitability of Copenhagen interpration of Quantum mechanics in the light of the existence of De-Broglie Bohm theory.
- [philosophy of mathematics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_maths_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the identity of indescirnables in mathematical structuralism.
- [philosophy of physics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Devoir_philophy_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the role of experiment to probe physical hypothesis.
- [philosophy of AI](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_IA_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the ethics of artificial intelligence in contemporary society.

### On Gauge theories

I would like to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and gauge interpretation of gravity and possible geometrisation of Yang-Mills theories rooted in differential geometry. Here are some of my first writing related to this topic: 

- [History of geodesic](https://leovacher.github.io/files/courbes-Vacher.pdf) curves from the end of the XVIIIth to the beggining of the XIXth century (french). 
- [History of connections and gauge theories](https://leovacher.github.io/files/connexion-Vacher.pdf) in the XXth century.
