After a [master's degree](https://master-physique.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/le-programme/master-psc/) in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I am currently a PHD student at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie ([IRAP](https://www.irap.omp.eu)) in Toulouse since 2020. You can find a detailled CV [here](files/CV.pdf).

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology, gravitation theory and galactic astrophysics. 

In this framework, I am an active member of the [LiteBIRD](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html) and the [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org) collaborations.

Beside research, I am involved in several teaching and outreach activities. I am teaching several fields at [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr). The detail of the classes can be found on this website. In collaboration with [Bastien Carreres](https://bcarreres.github.io), I also make available some of my lecture notes and codes for teaching purposes on [Yolonomy](https://yolonomy.github.io).

On my free time, I am also studying for a [master's degree](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead) in philosophy of science, aiming to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and gauge interpretations of gravity.

# Research interests

I am trying to understand the physics of the interstellar medium of our own galaxy in order to model accurately its polarized signal. I am especially interested by microwave thermal dust radiation. Understanding this signal is of first importance not only for astrophysics but in order to remove the foreground signal of the Milky Way to seek for new fundamental physics in the cosmic microwave background.

Concerning new physics, I am seeking for the limits of our standard models of particle physics and gravity by constraining models allowing for variation of fundamental constants, in direct violation with the Einstein equivalence principle, a cornerstone of general relativity (and all metric theories of gravity).

A list of my publications can be found on this website and also on [scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uLb6OyYAAAAJ&hl=fr&authuser=1), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Vacher%2C+L), [inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1969120?ui-citation-summary=true), [researchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leo-Vacher) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-9551-1417&sort=date+desc).
