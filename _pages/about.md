After a magister coupled to a [master's degree](https://master-physique.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/le-programme/master-psc/) in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I did my PHD in astrophysics and cosmology at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie ([IRAP](https://www.irap.omp.eu)) from 2020 to 2023. I am currently a research fellow at the International school for advanced research ([SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/)) in Trieste (Italy). You can find my detailled CV [here](files/CV.pdf) and the manuscript of my PHD thesis [here](files/Thesis-Vacher.pdf).

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology, gravitation theory and Galactic astrophysics. In this framework, I am an active member of the [*LiteBIRD*](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html) and the [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) collaborations.

Beside research, I am involved in several teaching and outreach activities. I am teaching several fields at [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr). The detail of the classes can be found on this website. In collaboration with [Bastien Carreres](https://bastiencarreres.github.io/), I also make available some of my lecture notes and codes for teaching purposes on [Yolonomy](https://yolonomy.github.io).

On my free time, I am also studying for a [master's degree](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead) in philosophy of science, aiming to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and gauge interpretations of gravity.

## Research interests

I am trying to understand the physics of the interstellar medium of our own galaxy in order to model accurately its polarized signal. I am especially interested by the microwave thermal dust radiation. Understanding this signal is of first importance not only for astrophysics but in order to remove the foreground signal of the Milky Way to seek for new fundamental physics in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.

In this framework, I am also involved in the instrumental design of the [*LiteBIRD*](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html) satellite. Besides foreground cleaning and galactic science, my work in the collaboration focuses on the optimization of the scanning strategy and the  the impact of large scale asymetries of the far side lobes on the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the smoking gun for cosmic inflation.

Unveiling the primordial signal of the CMB will ultimately provide information to constrain new high-energy physics beyond the reach of our particle accelerator. On this regard, I am seeking for the limits of our standard models of particle physics and gravity by constraining models allowing for variation of fundamental constants, in direct violation with the Einstein equivalence principle, a cornerstone of general relativity (and all metric theories of gravity). I am investigating how experiments like [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) and future CMB missions could probe these effects.
