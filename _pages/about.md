After a [master's degree](https://master-physique.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/le-programme/master-psc/) in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I am currently a PHD student at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie ([IRAP](https://www.irap.omp.eu)) in Toulouse since 2020. You can find my full CV [here](files/CV.pdf).

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology, gravitation theory and galactic astrophysics. 
In this framework, I am an active member of the LiteBIRD and the Euclid collaborations.

Beside research, I am involved in several teaching and outreach activities. On my free time, I am also studying for a [master's degree](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead) in philosophy of science, aiming to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and gauge interpretations of gravity.

# Research

A list of my publications can be found on [scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uLb6OyYAAAAJ&hl=fr&authuser=1), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Vacher%2C+L), [inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1969120?ui-citation-summary=true), [researchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leo-Vacher) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-9551-1417&sort=date+desc).


# Teachings 

I am teaching several fields at [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr) as: optics, thermodynamics, point mechanics and astrophysics.

I also make available some of my lecture notes and codes for teaching purposes on [Yolonomy](https://yolonomy.github.io).

# Outreach 

You can find some of my outreachs contributions at:
- [Exploreur](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/exploreur-litebird-en-quete-des-premieres-fractions-de-secondes-de-l-univers)
- [Pulsar](https://www.nfist.pt/pulsar/pulsar41)
- [Yolonomy](https://yolonomy.github.io)

I am also an active member in several associative projects as
- [Les étoiles brillent pour tous](http://ebpt.fr/association/)
- [UniverSciel](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=Universciel&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
- [UPS in space](https://www.upsinspace.com).

<!-- # Philosophy of science

I am currently doing a master's degree in [logic, history and philosophy of sciences](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead).
I would like to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and Gauge interpretation of gravity.
