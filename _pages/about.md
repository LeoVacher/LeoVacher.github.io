I am a permanent researcher (chargé de recherche) for the [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) based at [IJCLAB](https://www.ijclab.in2p3.fr/), in Orsay, south of Paris, France. After a magister coupled to a [master's degree](https://formations.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/catalogue-2021/master-XB/master-physique-IAQK7WZY/parcours-physique-subatomique-et-cosmologie-2e-annee-IAY1KEEB.html) in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I did my PHD in astrophysics and cosmology at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie ([IRAP](https://www.irap.omp.eu)) from 2020 to 2023. From 2023 to 2025, I was a research fellow at the International school for advanced research ([SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/)) in Trieste (Italy). You can find here my detailled [CV](files/CV.pdf), the manuscript of my [PHD thesis](files/Thesis-Vacher.pdf) as well as the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bkcXcH5ExecYRUcgoOJAfavtZJaMzHgd/view?usp=sharing) used for my PHD defense.

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology, gravitation theory and Galactic astrophysics. In this framework, I am an active member of the [*LiteBIRD*](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html), [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/) and the [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) collaborations. Beside research, I am involved in several teaching and outreach activities. I used to teach several topics at [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr). The detail of the classes can be found in the [teaching](/teaching/) section of this website. In collaboration with [Bastien Carreres](https://bastiencarreres.github.io/), I also make available some of my lecture notes and codes for teaching purposes on [Yolonomy](https://yolonomy.github.io).

On my free time, I also studied for a [master's degree](https://shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/formation/master-epistemologie-histoire-des-sciences-et-des-techniques-madelhis/) in philosophy of science. You can find more informations and some of my essays in the [philosophy](/philo/) section of this website.
I have a strong interest in philosophy and history of physics, especially regarding gauge theories -- at the foundation of our models of particle physics -- and their connection with general relativity. 

## Research interests

I am trying to understand the physics of the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy in order to model accurately its polarized signal. I am especially interested by the microwave thermal dust radiation. Understanding this signal is of first importance not only for astrophysics but also in order to remove the foreground signal of the Milky Way to seek for new fundamental physics in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. In particular, my work focuses mainly on the hunt for a faint pattern in the polarisation of the CMB, the so called primordial $B$-mode signal, which would provide a direct hint for the existence of a phase of violent acceleration in the first fraction of a second of our Universe's history: the cosmic inflation.

In this framework, I am an active member of the [*LiteBIRD*](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/future/litebird.html) and the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/) collaborations. Besides foreground removal and Galactic science, my work in the $LiteBIRD$ collaboration focuses on the optimization of the scanning strategy and the the impact of large scale asymetries of the far side lobes on the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the smoking gun for cosmic inflation.

Unveiling the primordial signal of the CMB will ultimately provide information to constrain new high-energy physics beyond the reach of our particle accelerator. On this regard, I am seeking for the limits of our standard models of particle physics and gravity by constraining models allowing for variation of fundamental constants, in direct violation with the Einstein equivalence principle, a cornerstone of general relativity (and all metric theories of gravity). I am investigating how experiments like [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) and future CMB missions could probe these effects.

A list of my publications and citing metrics can be found on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uLb6OyYAAAAJ&hl=fr&authuser=1), [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Vacher%2C+L), [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1969120?ui-citation-summary=true), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leo-Vacher) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-9551-1417&sort=date+desc).
