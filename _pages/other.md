### Summer and research schools

During my PHD, I attended to several research schools, as

- The [Euclid summer school](https://ecole-euclid.cnrs.fr), year 1 and 2 in France in 2021 and 2022.
- The [4th Azores School on Observational Cosmology](http://www.iastro.pt/research/conferences/azores21/): "Fundamental cosmology from the ELT and space". In 2021 at Angra do Heroísmo, Açores, Portugal.


### Philosophy of sciences and differential geometry

I am currently doing a master's degree in [logic, history and philosophy of sciences](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead).
I would like to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and Gauge interpretation of gravity with a strong grounding in differential geometry.

You can find here some of my short essays:
- [philosophy of mathematics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_maths_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the identity of indescirnables in mathematical structuralism.
- [philosophy of physics](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Devoir_philophy_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the role of experiment to probe physical hypothesis.
- [philosophy of AI](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Philo_IA_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the ethics of artificial intelligence in contemporary society.


### Hobbies

On my free time, I am a musician and music lover. For more than 8 years now, I played blues and irish music on the harmonica. I was also a drummer for more than 10 years.

On the sport side, I go climbing multiple times a week and when I can, I love practicing sliding sports as surf, longboard and bodyboard. 

I am also a huge biology nerd, reading a lot about genetics, botanic and marine life.
