### Philosophy of sciences and differential geometry

I am currently doing a master's degree in [logic, history and philosophy of sciences](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead).
I would like to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and Gauge interpretation of gravity.
