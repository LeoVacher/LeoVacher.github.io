### Philosophy of sciences and differential geometry

I am currently doing a master's degree in [logic, history and philosophy of sciences](https://philo.shs-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/resumes-des-cours-maldelhis-ead).
I would like to write a thesis on the interpretations of gauge theories and Gauge interpretation of gravity.

You can find here some of mu short essays:
- [philosophy of mathematics](files/Philo_maths_Vacher.pdf) (french). On the identity of indescirnables in mathematical structuralism.
- [philosophy of physics](files/Devoir_philophy_Vacher_original.pdf) (french). On the role of experiment to validate physical hypothesis.
