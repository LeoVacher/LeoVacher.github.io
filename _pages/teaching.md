## PHD with teaching duties (Doctorant chargé d’enseignements)


During my PHD thesis, I was a teaching assistant at [Université Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr) from 2020 to 2023. I was happily in charge of the following modules:

- **Astrophysics L3:** One semester of tutorials (12h) for an introduction to astrophysics in third year. [Kepler laws](https://yolonomy.github.io/codes/meca/Kepler), [black holes](https://leovacher.github.io/files/BH.pdf), [stellar evolution](https://leovacher.github.io/files/HR.pdf), [dark matter](https://leovacher.github.io/files/DM.pdf) and [cosmology](https://leovacher.github.io/files/cosmo.pdf) (links points to some of the slides/notes I used as illustrations in parallel of black board computations).

- **Fluid mechanics L2:** One semester of tutorials (14h). Detailled study of static, perfect and viscous fluids.

- **Thermodynamics L2:** Two semesters of tutorials for a total of three groups (45h) in thermodynamics in second year. Basic principles, equation of states, first (energy) and second (entropy) principles, thermodynamics functions, phase transitions. 

- **Point mechanics (L1):** One semester of tutorials (15h) in Newtonian point mechanics in first year. Cinematics, dynamics and energetics.

- **Geometric/Ray optics (L1):** One semester of tutorials (16h). Snell-Descartes laws, plane and spherical medium transition, study of the human eye an its optical defects, lenses and mirrors.

- **Labs (L1):** Labs in first year. Mechanics (21h) and electrocinetics (18h)

- **Light and color (L1):** Tutorials, supervision and evaluation of interdisciplinary student project about light (physics/biology/chemestry) in first year (18h).

(L1, L2 and L3 correspond respecitvely to first second and third year of bachelor's degree)

## Internship supervisions

- **J. Delhomelle (L2 - 2 months)** - Solving cosmological tensions with scalar field induced variations of fundamental constants. Lead to an [outreach publication](https://yolonomy.github.io/codes/cosmo/friedmann/).

- **S. Vinzl (L2 - 7 months) -** Extended Bekenstein model and study of the variation of fundamental constants. Lead to a [journal publication](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.083522).

- **N. Gentil (L2 - 7 months) -** Quantifying the impact of Far Side Lobes asymmetries for the LiteBIRD mission. Provided significant contributions detailled in my [thesis](https://leovacher.github.io/files/Thesis-Vacher.pdf).

## Other

Here are some other teaching duties I contributed to:

- Marker for the [PLANCKS-2021]((https://2021.plancks.org)) event, cosmology session.
- Employee of the [Insignis association](http://association-insignis.fr/) from 2017 to 2018 (Teaching mathematics to secondary and high school students classes).
