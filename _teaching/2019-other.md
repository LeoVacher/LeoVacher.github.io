Here are some other teaching duties I contributed to:

- Marker for the [PLANCKS-2021]((https://2021.plancks.org)) event, cosmology session.
- Employee of the [Insignis association](http://association-insignis.fr/) from 2017 to 2018 (Teaching mathematics to secondary and high school students classes).
